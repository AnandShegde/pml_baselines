add the data that you have used here.


I thought we can save the data in form of a dictionary.

like this:

{'data': whatever_data, 'prior': whatever prior that we are using}

I have used pickle for saving the data.
syntax is like this


import pickle

a = {'hello': 'world'}

with open('filename.pickle', 'wb') as handle:
    pickle.dump(a, handle, protocol=pickle.HIGHEST_PROTOCOL)

with open('filename.pickle', 'rb') as handle:
    b = pickle.load(handle)

print(a == b)
